# SVG-Generator

Project description
This is a project that is used in the integrated terminal using the inquiry function. We will prompt the user for different input that will then be used to generate a scalable vector graphic upon running the application. The user will be prompted with three questions. The user will be asked to input up to three characters, as well as a background color and a shape for the scalable vector graphic the options are circle triangle and square. Then a function is used to dynamically generate a scalable vector graphic this new scalable vector graphic will be generated on a new page that is created called logo.SVG.
Additionally, we will be using just to run test to make sure that the SVGâ€˜s are being created correctly.

User instructions
